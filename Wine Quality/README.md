## üç∑ Wine Quality Analysis<br>

This project analyzes the physicochemical properties of wine and builds classification models to predict wine quality. Using a labeled dataset of red and white wines, the project explores relationships between features like acidity, alcohol, and pH, and applies supervised machine learning algorithms to classify wines into quality categories. This can assist wine manufacturers and enthusiasts in identifying high-quality wines based on their chemical profiles.<br>

### üìä Objective

To develop a predictive model that classifies wine quality based on its physicochemical characteristics, enabling early quality estimation during the production process and aiding in quality control.<br?
- Perform EDA on wine data to discover feature relationships.
- Visualize distributions, correlations, and addresses class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Identify key attributes that influence wine quality (like alcohol, acidity, sugar, etc.).
