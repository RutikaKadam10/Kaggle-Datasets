Project Name: Data Visualization of MNIST Dataset using PCA and t-SNE

Description:
This project demonstrates dimensionality reduction and visualization techniques on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. By leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), the project explores how high-dimensional data can be effectively reduced and visualized in two or three dimensions for better interpretability and insights.

Key Features:<br>
Performed preprocessing of the MNIST dataset for dimensionality reduction.<br>
Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality while retaining maximum variance in the data.<br>
Used t-SNE for non-linear dimensionality reduction to visualize complex patterns and clusters in the dataset.<br>
Compared and analyzed the results of PCA and t-SNE visualizations.<br>
Highlighted how dimensionality reduction techniques can aid in understanding high-dimensional datasets.<br>

Technologies and Libraries:<br>
Python<br>
NumPy, Pandas<br>
Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>
Scikit-learn<br>
